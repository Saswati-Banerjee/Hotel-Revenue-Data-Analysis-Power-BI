# Hotel-Revenue-Data-Analysis-Power-BI<br/>
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.<br/>

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.<br/>
